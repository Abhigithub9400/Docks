📄 Azure Storage: Lifecycle Management Guide

This guide explains how to automate cost savings by moving older data to cheaper storage tiers (Archive) using the Azure Portal.
1. The Goal

Automatically move blobs to the Archive Tier after 180 days (6 months) to reduce storage costs by ~90%.
2. UI Setup Steps

    Open Storage Account: Navigate to your target Storage Account in the Azure Portal.

    Access Lifecycle Management: Under the Data management sidebar, click Lifecycle management.

    Add a Rule:

        Rule name: archive-after-180-days

        Rule scope: Select Limit blobs with filters (to target specific containers).

        Blob type: Base blobs + Block blobs.

    Define Action:

        Condition: Days after last modification

        Value: 180

        Action: Move to archive

    Configure Filters:

        In the Filter set tab, add the container name with a trailing slash.

        Example: my-container-name/

        Note: This ensures only data in this specific container is archived.

3. Critical Billing Rules
Rule	Detail
Storage Savings	Archive is ~90% cheaper than Hot tier storage.
Minimum Retention	180 days. If you delete data before 180 days, you still pay for the full 180 days.
Rehydration	Moving data back to "Hot" takes 15 hours (Standard) or 1 hour (High Priority).
Retrieval Cost	There is a per-GB fee to "read" data out of the Archive tier.
